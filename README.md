## Hello World, I'm Thiago Tim, welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in Social Sciences at University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2009 and I finished my Master Degree in Anthropology in 2018 where I studied the role of digital technologies in political practices. 
Nowadays, I have been studying machine learning techniques (specifically neural networks and natural language processing), data science and Python.
