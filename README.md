### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in Social Sciences at University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2009 and I finished my Master Degree in Anthropology in 2018 where I studied the role of digital technologies in political practices. 
Nowadays, I have been studying Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS and Node) and Python.
